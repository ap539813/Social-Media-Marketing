      "Just because you‚Äôre ‚Äúfrom‚Äù somewhere doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre ethnically from there. So her being from Puerto Rico doesn‚Äôt make her Latina.\n",
      "Same, since my mother is white, and my father is technically half spaniard, I consider myself white latin\n",
      "I am latina too, born in Venezuela, I am also a linguist, as in I have a masters in Spanish linguistics...and believe me, it is a redundant term. Either way, I should have known better than to comment, I am just so tired of this new trent. My apologies, but for what is worth, even the REA is tired of it too.\n",
      "Yes. :)\n",
      "Not only PR and Mexico. Most of all countries in central and South America as well. That‚Äôs what colonization and genocide brings: mestizaje.\n",
      "For centuries the Celts weren't considered white despite the colour of their skin. At what line to we make the distinction between culture and skin colour for being \"white\" ?\n",
      "Theres no point in debating these overly-woke people, I have no idea in what world JLo would be considered white, she‚Äôs morena af. Pinche gente pendeja ‚Äúomg you‚Äôre not latinX PoC‚Äù. So glad this shit is only localized to Twitter.\n",

      "It's the Republican party, not the reading comprehension party! They have ultimate loyalty to what they imagine the Bible says ‚Äî way too much to disrupt that by reading it!\n",
      "Ugh, yeah, I'm sorry ‚Äî I know there are many wonderful Christians who take their faith seriously and care about the principles it actually teaches. My parents are in that group and have been just heartbroken to see other people at their church, in our extended family, etc. use religion as their excuse du jour.\n",

      "I‚Äôm Latinx born in Chile and minored in Spanish. Believe me, I don‚Äôt care what the REA thinks or about your masters degree. Languages and terms develop and I like the term for a lot of reasons so I‚Äôll continue to use it thanks. Lots of other Latinxs like the term too so just stop trying to correct ppl about it. Ya basta, tenemos temas m√°s importante para discutir.\n",
      "I lived in Corvallis and Salem for a couple years each. It‚Äôs like a group of people that hides their racial biases behind an ‚Äúeducated hippie‚Äù veneer. My limited experience in Eugene was even worse.\n",
      "Seemed insidious too, like not overly malicious in tone, but just completely entrenched in their worldview that non-white people require a certain level of distrust\n",
      "Yeah! I mentioned PR and Mexico specifically because of the mention of J.Lo and Camilla, I'm also a mixed South American :)\n",
      "That's because \"race\", as a new way of characterising people, came into use in the 16thC, if not slightly earlier, and was heavily perpetuated with the rise of European empires in the 17thC and 18thC - obviously with chattel slavery, but also with the exploration of the South Pacific etc.. Also I think the creation of the nation state in the 18thC helped with \"the othering\"- i.e. people had  new way of collecting, nationalism. Before then, people largely grouped together and were defined by their religion/religious practices.\n",
      "I really want to know in what world (besides Twitter) this makes sense. So many Latinos/as are said to be ‚Äúwhite passing‚Äù even though if they lived in the states they would never be considered white by gringos.\n",
      "While I agree with their overall point, they lost me with \"J.Lo is white\"... no, she's not.\n",
      "JLo morena? Don't let the fake tan fool you lol\n",
      "I thought you were being sarcastic at first and was like oh no but I appreciate you responding to my comment. The Republican Party is NOT the party of God and I hope people realize it\n",
      "uhh no thanks, valuing the cult of celebrity over actual politics is how we got into this mess\n",
      "Exactly lol.\n",
      "I prefer Latine personally, but I don't mind Latinx. I don't know why people get so pissed about it, it doesn't hurt anyone.\n",
      "You‚Äôre good! Just wanted to add because there‚Äôs so many comments of people who I‚Äôm just assuming are very confused or know little to nothing about latam\n",
      "Yea the goal posts of what is considered being white is moving, but not in a way to dismantle white supremacy. Just to silence the voices of mixed race people who may benefit from colorism.\n",
      "Yeah I don‚Äôt understand that sentiment. We‚Äôre too white too be Latinos but not white enough to be Caucasian....\n",
      " \n",
      "My skin might be lighter compared to the rest of my Latino family members but my phenotypes are clearly not white.\n",
      "Same, idk how person I was replying to could ever perceive J.Lo and Cabello as white, or benefitting from white privilege in any way. Maybe in a colorism sense? Idk.\n",
      "Why am I getting downvoted for this comment? JLo is not brown. She is a white latina.  Fake tan doesn't change that.\n",
      "omg, no, no sarcasm here! It's 2021. I don't have the energy to do laundry, let alone be mean to genuinely nice people on the internet. :)\n",
      "I also like Latine! But more people seem to know Latinx for now so that‚Äôs what I go with.\n",
      "Yea Cabello is a racist but J Lo and her I have never seen as being white ever. And I don‚Äôt think most people do either.\n"
